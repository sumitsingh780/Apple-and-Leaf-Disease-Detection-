# Apple-and-Leaf-Disease-Detection-
This repository contains code for detecting diseases in apple leaves using the Inception v3 model. The model is trained on a dataset of images of healthy and diseased apple leaves, allowing it to classify new images as either healthy or showing signs of disease.

Key Features:

Leveraging cutting-edge deep learning architectures, including Inception v3 and ResNet, for apple leaf disease detection.
Extensive experimentation and comparative analysis reveal that the Inception v3 model consistently achieves the best accuracy among the models evaluated.
Preprocessing techniques tailored to enhance image quality and extract discriminative features, ensuring optimal performance of the models.
Trained on a diverse dataset encompassing various diseases and health conditions affecting apple leaves.
Evaluation metrics provide insights into model performance, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Comprehensive documentation guides users on utilizing the model for inference on new images and adapting the codebase for further research and development.
By prioritizing the Inception v3 model based on its superior accuracy, this repository empowers researchers and practitioners in agriculture to deploy robust solutions for early detection and management of diseases in apple crops, ultimately contributing to improved crop yields and sustainability.
